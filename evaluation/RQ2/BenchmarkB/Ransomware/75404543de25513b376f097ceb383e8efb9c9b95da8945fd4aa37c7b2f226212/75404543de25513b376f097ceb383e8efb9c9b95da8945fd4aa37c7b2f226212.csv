sub_40F2EE,"The function appears to be setting up a state for a ChaCha encryption cipher, initializing constants and key and nonce inputs. The presence of 'expand 32-byte k' is characteristic of a ChaCha cipher setup operation.",sub_401FA6,['MoveFile'],sub_40C41A,['FindFirstFile'],sub_41418C,['CreateFile'],,
sub_411467,"This function resembles the structure and operations used in encryption algorithms, specifically reminiscent of the ChaCha stream cipher. It involves a series of bitwise rotations and additions typical in such cryptographic functions.",,,sub_410998,['FindNextFile'],,,,
sub_4237C7,"The function appears to perform modular exponentiation on large integers, which is a common operation in cryptographic algorithms like RSA. It checks for zero modulo cases and manipulates blocks of integers, further indicating possible use in cryptographic contexts.",,,,,,,,
