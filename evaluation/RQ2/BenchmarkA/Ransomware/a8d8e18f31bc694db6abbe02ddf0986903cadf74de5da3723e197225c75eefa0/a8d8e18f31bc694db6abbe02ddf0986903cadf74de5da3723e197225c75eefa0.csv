sub_40710F,"The function initializes a 32-byte state with constants and input keys, resembling part of a ChaCha20 encryption setup phase.",,,sub_41B835,['FindNextFile'],,,,
sub_41AB85,"This function appears to implement rounds involving bitwise operations, rotations (ROL), and the addition of vectors, which is characteristic of stream cipher algorithms or block cipher transformation steps, making it a potential candidate for an encryption function like a variant of the Salsa20 or ChaCha stream cipher.",,,,,,,,
sub_41BBA9,"The function implements a modular exponentiation operation, which is a common operation used in cryptographic algorithms such as RSA for encryption, decryption, and key generation. This suggests it is likely part of a cryptographic routine.",,,,,,,,
