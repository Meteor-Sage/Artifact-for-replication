sub_405E29,"The function appears to perform a series of XOR operations and table lookups based on input data and keys. It uses several transformation tables, suggesting potential use of an encryption algorithm similar to block ciphers such as AES which use S-boxes for substitution. The function modifies the input data considerably, which is indicative of cryptographic processing.",sub_400A38,['WriteFile'],sub_402614,"['FindNextFile', 'FindFirstFile']",sub_408370,"['CreateFile', 'ReadFile']",sub_40220F,['Snapshot']
sub_408565,"The function appears to implement a cryptographic transformation or block cipher operation. It uses multiple XOR operations combined with lookup tables (dword_40362C, dword_4029ED, dword_400AF3, dword_403852, byte_401E51) to modify data, which is characteristic of encryption algorithms.",sub_403142,['WriteFile'],,,sub_40896D,['CreateFile'],,
sub_40381A,"The function appears to engage in cryptographic operations, as it manipulates data using byte-wise operations, conditionally employs lookup tables, and processes data in multiple rounds. Though not matching a recognizable standard algorithm, its behavior reflects common encryption function characteristics.",StartAddress,"['DeleteFile', 'WriteFile']",,,sub_403142,['CreateFile'],,
sub_40A370,The function appears to implement parts of AES encryption or a similar algorithm. It involves setting up S-boxes and transformation operations reminiscent of what is typically found in symmetric encryption algorithms like AES.,sub_403A4A,['WriteFile'],,,StartAddress,['CreateFile'],,
