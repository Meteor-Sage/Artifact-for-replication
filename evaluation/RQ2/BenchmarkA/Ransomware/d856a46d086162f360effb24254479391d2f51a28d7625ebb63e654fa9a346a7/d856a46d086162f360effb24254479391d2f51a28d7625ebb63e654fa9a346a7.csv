sub_404E6E,"This function appears to perform key setup operations, likely for the ChaCha20 cipher, as indicated by 'expand 32-byte k', which is a characteristic keyword of the initialization process in the ChaCha20 algorithm.",,,,,,,,
sub_41AD2C,"Potential modular arithmetic and bit manipulation operations suggestive of cryptographic processing, likely related to number theory common in encryption functions.",,,,,,,,
sub_41F6D1,"The function implements a data transformation process resembling ChaCha or Salsa20 stream cipher operations. It performs numerous bitwise rotations and additions in a loop, which are typical characteristics of certain stream cipher algorithms.",,,,,,,,
sub_41840D,"The function appears to perform operations related to modular exponentiation involving the calculation of powers of a number modulo another number ('mpz_powm'), which is a common operation in encryption algorithms such as RSA.",,,,,,,,
sub_4154D0,"The function appears to perform complex data modifications and bit manipulations, which are characteristic of encryption processes. It also calls other functions like sub_413BA4, which seem to be involved in bit-level operations, possibly related to block or stream cipher operations. However, without full context, it is challenging to confirm the specific encryption algorithm.",,,,,,,,
