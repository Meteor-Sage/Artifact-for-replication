sub_407874,"This function is likely related to a block cipher or stream cipher setup, as it manipulates data in a form that suggests initialization of cryptographic structures.",,,,,,,,
sub_404177,"The function appears to perform several rounds of bitwise operations, including rotations and additions on 128-bit SSE registers. These operations are characteristic of symmetric encryption algorithms such as those used in block ciphers.",,,,,,,,
sub_40C6D7,Potential encryption or modification of data content read into memory.,,,,,,,,
sub_40C1A1,Potential encryption or modification of data content read into memory. The function manipulates data read from a file using another function sub_40F0ED which hints at encryption or similar data processing operations.,,,,,,,,
sub_40F0ED,"Potential encryption or modification of data content using SIMD operations, involving XOR operations and possible state tracking.",,,,,,,,
