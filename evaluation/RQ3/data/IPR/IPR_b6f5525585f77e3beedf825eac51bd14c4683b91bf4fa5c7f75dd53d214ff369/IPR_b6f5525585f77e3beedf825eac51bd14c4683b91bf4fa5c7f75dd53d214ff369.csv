sub_142AD43C1,"The function appears to be implementing a variant of the SHA-512 hashing algorithm. This is determined by observing constants, bitwise operations, looping structure, and memory manipulation, commonly associated with SHA-512.",,,,,,,Z17_c32ef15adecfbcf9v,['Snapshot']
sub_142EB4600,The function appears to perform encryption by modifying data content read into memory using XOR operations in conjunction with sub_149834BC9.,,,,,,,,
sub_149834BC9,"This function appears to be implementing an encryption algorithm, as it features bit operations like bitwise XOR, bit shifts, and rotations typically seen in encryption routines.",,,,,,,,
sub_1418710C7,"This function performs operations that resemble an encryption algorithm. It modifies and manipulates data using SIMD instructions (_mm_loadu_si128, _mm_shuffle_epi32, _mm_and_si128, _mm_xor_si128, etc.), processes large blocks of data in specific patterns, and implements key schedules or transformations, which is characteristic of encryption algorithms.",,,,,,,,
