sub_41BE0C,"The function appears to perform a series of operations that closely resemble the structure of a cryptographic hash function algorithm, particularly one that modifies data in memory. The use of operations like bit rotation, addition, and bitwise operations in large iterative loops are characteristic of cryptographic functions.",,,,,,,,
sub_4192B7,"Potential implementation of a cryptographic algorithm, likely related to a block cipher given the operations involving data transformation, bitwise operations, and multiple rounds of processing.",,,,,,,,
